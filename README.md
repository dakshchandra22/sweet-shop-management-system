o Which AI tools you used (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.).

o How you used them (e.g., "I used Gemini to brainstorm API endpoint structures," or "I asked Copilot to generate unit tests for my service layer").

o Your reflection on how AI impacted your workflow.

· Interview Discussion: Be prepared to discuss your AI usage in detail during the interview. We are interested in how you leverage these tools effectively and responsibly.
